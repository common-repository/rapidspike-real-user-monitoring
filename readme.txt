== Description ==

Ever wondered how your site performs from a user's perspective? Well look no further - this simple RapidSpike plugin helps you record live performance data from <a href="https://www.rapidspike.com/blog/real-user-monitoring/">real users</a>. It can even be used to track dynamic pages like an "Order Confirmation" page. This plugin will automatically configure your Wordpress blog and your RapidSpike account will begin tracking performance data as soon as visitors arrive on your website!

**Effortless Set Up!**

**Automatic Alerts**

This is great for monitoring dynamic confirmation pages, landing pages and other critical parts of your site.
